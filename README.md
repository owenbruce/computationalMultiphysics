# computationalMultiphysics

This is a repository of all of the coding files from Engphys 2CM4. This includes Maple, FlexPDE, and Python files to simulate and optimize a variety of different scenarios.
 
The repository is organized with a folder for each week containing all of the program files for that week's problems, assignment, and test. The name of the folder will indicate the week as well as the topic.

In addition, there is a final folder containing information about the final project where I simulated and optimized a rocket propulsion system to work on the moon.
